<!-- # What does this do?
This is a VS Code extension (Better Latex Syntax). It helps highlight your nix code better, including the code inside `shellHook`s. If your theme is good (please do not use the default theme), the colors themselves should look better. I'd recommended Atom One Dark, Tokyo Night, Cobalt Next, Bearded Theme (tons of variants), Noctis, XD Theme.
